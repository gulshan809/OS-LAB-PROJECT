# security-access-model 
This project implements a basic Access Control System with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Win32 API. It features user authentication and role-based access control, along with resource permission management And logs access attempts.  The project is implemented using Windows API and C++, demonstrating a fundamental security model. It provides a foundation for more advanced access control systems. The GUI allows users to interact with the system easily.
